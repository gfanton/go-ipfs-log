# go-ipfs-log

> An append-only log on IPFS.

`ipfs-log` is an immutable, operation-based conflict-free replicated data structure ([CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)) for distributed systems. It's an append-only log that can be used to model a mutable, shared state between peers in p2p applications.

Every entry in the log is saved in IPFS and each points to a hash of previous entry(ies) forming a graph. Logs can be forked and joined back together.

```
           Log A                Log B
             |                    |
     logA.append("one")   logB.append("hello")
             |                    |
             v                    v
          +-----+             +-------+
          |"one"|             |"hello"|
          +-----+             +-------+
             |                    |
     logA.append("two")   logB.append("world")
             |                    |
             v                    v
       +-----------+       +---------------+
       |"one","two"|       |"hello","world"|
       +-----------+       +---------------+
             |                    |
             |                    |

             |

## Background

IPFS Log has a few use cases:

- CRDTs
- Database operations log
- Feed of data
- Track a version of a file
- Messaging

[ipfs-log](https://github.com/orbitdb/ipfs-log/) was originally created for [orbit-db](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db) - a distributed peer-to-peer database on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs). This library intends to provide a fully compatible port of the JavaScript version in Go.

## Install

This project uses [go](https://golang.org/).

```
go get github.com/berty/go-ipfs-log
```

## Usage

See the [API documentation](#api) for more details.

### Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```go
// TODO
```

Run a simple program:

```go

```

## API

## Contribute

If you find a bug or something is broken, let us know! PRs and [issues](https://github.com/berty/go-ipfs-log/issues) are gladly accepted too. Take a look at the open issues, too, to see if there is anything that you could do or someone else has already done. Here are some things I know I need:

### TODO

- Ensure 1-1 compatibility with JS version
